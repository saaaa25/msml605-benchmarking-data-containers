## 🔧 **Prerequisites**  
Before running this notebook, ensure you have:  
- A **Google account** (to access [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)).  
- The **`.ipynb` file** (uploaded to Google Drive/GitHub or locally stored).

## ⚙️ **Setup in Google Colab**  

### **Option 1: Open from GitHub**  
1. Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).  
2. Click the **GitHub** tab.  
3. Paste this repository URL or `.ipynb` file link → Press **Enter**.  

### **Option 2: Upload Manually**  
1. Download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
4. Click **File** → **Open notebook** → **Upload** -> **Browse** -> Select your `.ipynb` file.

## 🎯 **Running the Code**  
1. **Set Runtime**:  
   - Click **Runtime** → **Change runtime type** → Select **Python 3** + **GPU/TPU** (when running GPU codes).  

2. **Download and Upload Images**:
   For Colab:
   - Upload the image files from /images to the sample_data folder of Colab files.
   - The path of images should be 'content/sample_data/image_name.jpg' for the code to run successfully.

3. **Run**:
   - Run the code to see results.

## Take Note:
   The MSML605_GPU_Codes_2.ipynb has NUMBA code which best runs on kaggle. To run this on Kaggle.
1. Download the notebook and /images to your local machine.
2. Open Kaggle and import your notebook.
3. Upload the /images folder to the kaggle input. The path of the images folder should be '/kaggle/input/images' for the code to run successfully.
4. Run the code to see results.
